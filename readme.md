Sophie and Adam: please let me know if you have any questions!
I used a MutationObserver in order to account for race condition that was caused by how Vue renders the templates. I needed to make sure the signin-form was fully rendered before I could instruct for the image and the blue corner triangle to appear. 
I would love the chance to discuss other ways about this in creating changes to the templates onClick that are set up in the HTML of the action buttons.  
Thank you!

### Technical Review  

Using the included assets 'from the client' (assets_from_client.zip), please re-create the screens detailed in the mockup - without adjusting the template in `index.html`, the CSS in `styles.css`, or the base level Vue functionality in `login.js`. Make sure to review all of the files to famaliarize yourself with the project!

Please use `custom.css` for your styling and `scripts.js` for any scripts.

#### Bonus

Can the password validation be updated or refactored?

Are all of the screens detailed in the mock up? Make sure to run through both the register and sign in flow.
