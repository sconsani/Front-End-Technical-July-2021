### Technical Review  

Using the included assets 'from the client' (assets_from_client.zip), please re-create the screens detailed in the mockup - without adjusting the template in `index.html`, the CSS in `styles.css`, or the base level Vue functionality in `login.js`. Make sure to review all of the files to famaliarize yourself with the project!

Please use `custom.css` for your styling and `scripts.js` for any scripts.

#### Bonus

Can the password validation be updated or refactored?

Are all of the screens detailed in the mock up? Make sure to run through both the register and sign in flow.
